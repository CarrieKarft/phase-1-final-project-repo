# My Reading List Web Application

My reading list is a web application that looks up book titles using the Open Library API 
# (linked here: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search). 
When using My Reading List a user can enter in the title of a book that they want to read into the search bar. When the user clicks the "submit" button My Reading List will search the API for books that match that title. The title, author, and subjects of books that match the search will then be displayed on the web page under the search bar in the "search field". If the user finds a book in the search results that they would like to read later they can click on the specific book, and drag it over the the "reading list" section. Once the user releases the mouse the title of the selected book will be displayed in their "reading list", and the book will be saved. Once the book is stored in the "reading list" the user can scroll over the title of any of their saved books to enlarge the text. Scrolling over a book in the "reading list" will also display a hidden button labled with an "X". The user can click the button to delete the specified title from their "reading list". Once the "X" button is clicked the title will be removed form the "reading list". This process can be repeted to look up, add, and remove as many books as the user wants.
